To determine whether a problem is supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
SUPERVISE LEARNING IS OF TWO TYPES: 
      1. REGRESSION
      2. CLASSIFICATION
1. **Input and Output**: A supervised problem must have both input data and corresponding output labels.
2. **Regression Problem**: If the output is a numerical value, we classify it as a regression problem.
3. **Classification Problem**: If the output represents categories or classes, it falls into the category of classification problems.


To determine whether a problem is UN-supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
unsupervised learning is of 4 types: 
    1. Clustering
    2. Dimensionality reduction
    3. Anamoly detection
    4. Association rule learning

3. Semisupervised
4. Reinforcement.

There are two types of learning used in production level. 
   1. Batch learning
   2. Online learning
Batch learning = In this learning we pull the data to our local store there we train our model and later we deploy on servers so that users can use. 
                  But it's has some limitations like you won't be able to train the current data which is the available on the server for the moment.
                  it's rigrous process you have to daily or weekly or montly need to pull data from server and train it and again deploy on server.

Online learning = In this learning we train our model and if the model detects the new parameters it also learn from it real time which make the user experience seamless. 
                  it's risky and tricky. 
                  There are two libraries which we used for training on streaming data 
                  1. Riverr
                  2. Vowpal rabbit
