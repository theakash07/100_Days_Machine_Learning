To determine whether a problem is supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
SUPERVISE LEARNING IS OF TWO TYPES: 
      1. REGRESSION
      2. CLASSIFICATION
1. **Input and Output**: A supervised problem must have both input data and corresponding output labels.
2. **Regression Problem**: If the output is a numerical value, we classify it as a regression problem.
3. **Classification Problem**: If the output represents categories or classes, it falls into the category of classification problems.


To determine whether a problem is UN-supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
unsupervised learning is of 4 types: 
    1. Clustering
    2. Dimensionality reduction
    3. Anamoly detection
    4. Association rule learning

3. Semisupervised
4. Reinforcement.

There are two types of learning used in production level. 
   1. Batch learning
   2. Online learning
Batch learning = In this learning we pull the data to our local store there we train our model and later we deploy on servers so that users can use. 
                  But it's has some limitations like you won't be able to train the current data which is the available on the server for the moment.
                  it's rigrous process you have to daily or weekly or montly need to pull data from server and train it and again deploy on server.

Online learning = In this learning we train our model and if the model detects the new parameters it also learn from it real time which make the user experience seamless. 
                  it's risky and tricky. 
                  There are two libraries which we used for training on streaming data 
                  1. Riverr.
                  2. Vowpal rabbit.

======How our machine learning model learns ? ==============
THere are Two types of model learning.
 1. Instance based leanring.
 2. Model based learning.

    1. Instance based Learning:
                               Instance based leanring is like Cramming. 
                               In this learning your algorithms doesn't learn from the data it just simply holds the data.
                               when query comes it's finds the nearest data point of the query and make prediciton accordinng to it.

                               Some popular instance-based learning algorithms include:

                                    1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
                                    2. Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
                                    3. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
                                    4. Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)
2. Model Based Learning : 
                         This learning is generalisation of best fit on the training data.

1. Data collection : We collect data from two ways 
                     1. Api
                     2. Web Scrapping

2. Insufficient Labelled data :

3. Non - Representative Data.
          1. Sampling Noise
          2. Sampling Bias.

4. Poor Quality oF Data:
5. Irrelevant Features : if you will opt irrelevant feature the output will be irrelevant. 
6. Overfitting.
7. UnderFit.
8. Software Integration.
9. Offline learning / deployment.
10.Cost Involved.

1. Application of Machine learning in B2B( bussiness to Bussiness). 
  A. Retail - Amazon / BigBazaar
  B. Banking And Finanace.
  C. Transport - Ola
  D. Manufacturing - Tesla
  E. Consumer Internet - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram e.t.c....!
                  
2. Machine Learning Development Life Cycle
  A. Frame the Model:  
                     In this stage you define wether to use supervised or unseupervised , batch learning or online learningm , is it instance based or Model based leanring. 
                     What will be the cost and all the things..

 B. Gathering Data : 
                    Use own data, gather data via API or WebScrapping.
 C. Data Preprocessing:
 D. Exploratory Data Analysis:
                   Use Graphs to VIsulaize
                   Univariate analysis: you analyse each columns in data set.
                   Bi-Variate analysis : you analyse two columns together to find the rlation between them.
                   MultiVariate analysis : You analyse more than two columns to understad the relationship between them. 
                   tackling the imbalance of data...
E. Feature Engineering Columns : 
                                Input columns are known as features.
                                 you can create relevant columns from available columns..
