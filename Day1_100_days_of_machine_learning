To determine whether a problem is supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
SUPERVISE LEARNING IS OF TWO TYPES: 
      1. REGRESSION
      2. CLASSIFICATION
1. **Input and Output**: A supervised problem must have both input data and corresponding output labels.
2. **Regression Problem**: If the output is a numerical value, we classify it as a regression problem.
3. **Classification Problem**: If the output represents categories or classes, it falls into the category of classification problems.


To determine whether a problem is UN-supervised or not, we can examine the following conditions:
unsupervised learning is of 4 types: 
    1. Clustering
    2. Dimensionality reduction
    3. Anamoly detection
    4. Association rule learning
